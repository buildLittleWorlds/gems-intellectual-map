    <h1 class="page-title">What Is an Intellectual Map?</h1>

    <p class="lead">If you've just completed the <a href="index.html">Building a Week of Writing</a> sequence, you've already used a Gem as a <em>drafting</em> tool &mdash; helping you write and accumulate context across a week. This sequence is about a different use: building a Gem that helps you <em>see</em> what you've been writing about, where you fit in a larger conversation, and what intellectual traditions you're participating in.</p>

    <p>The tool you're building is called an <strong>intellectual map</strong>. By the end of this sequence, you'll have built three progressively more powerful versions of it. (If you haven't done the <a href="index.html">preface sequence</a> yet, that's fine &mdash; you can start here.)</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>The Aspirational Model</h2>

    <p>To see what a hand-built intellectual map looks like, open <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/engl170-spring2026-dashboard/writing-plan.html">Dr. Plate's annotated bibliography</a>. That page does several things at once:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It identifies the <strong>core sources</strong> behind the author's argument and explains what each one contributes</li>
      <li>It maps how <strong>other writers' work</strong> connects to those sources &mdash; which ideas are in conversation with which thinkers</li>
      <li>It traces the <strong>relationships</strong> between different writers &mdash; who is extending, challenging, or complicating whose argument</li>
      <li>It identifies a <strong>larger intellectual thread</strong> (the dystopian framing problem) that ties everything together</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That page was built by hand. It took weeks of reading, tracking, and connecting. Your intellectual map won't replicate it exactly &mdash; but it will approximate some of its functions using AI.</p>

    <div class="callout insight">
      <p><strong>The core insight:</strong> The more context you give an AI tool &mdash; better instructions, better documents &mdash; the more it can see patterns you haven't noticed. A Gem with only your writing sees your work. A Gem with your writing, others' writing, and scholarly sources sees the <em>conversation</em>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Drafting Gems vs. Analytical Gems</h2>

    <p>If you completed the <a href="index.html">Building a Week of Writing</a> sequence, you built a Gem that helped you draft &mdash; something that generates outlines, suggests counterarguments, or helps structure an essay. That's a <strong>drafting Gem</strong>. It helps you produce new writing.</p>

    <p>An <strong>analytical Gem</strong> is different. It doesn't help you write &mdash; it helps you <em>understand what you've already written</em>. It reads your collected work and identifies patterns, gaps, contradictions, and connections you might not have seen.</p>

    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Drafting Gem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Helps you write <em>new</em> content</li>
          <li>Generates ideas, outlines, drafts</li>
          <li>Looks forward: "What should I write?"</li>
          <li>Knowledge files: source material</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Analytical Gem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Helps you see <em>existing</em> patterns</li>
          <li>Finds themes, contradictions, gaps</li>
          <li>Looks backward: "What have I been arguing?"</li>
          <li>Knowledge files: your own writing</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The analytical Gem is the more powerful tool. Anyone can ask AI to help them write a paragraph. Asking AI to read your collected work and tell you what argument you've been building without realizing it &mdash; that's a genuinely new capability.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>The Three Versions You'll Build</h2>

    <p>Over the next three pages, you'll build three Gems. Each one adds more context, and with more context comes deeper insight.</p>

    <table class="tool-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Version</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>What It Sees</th>
          <th>What It Does</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>1</strong></td>
          <td>My Argument Tracker</td>
          <td>Your own writing</td>
          <td>Finds patterns in your work</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>2</strong></td>
          <td>Network Position Mapper</td>
          <td>Your writing + peer/colleague writing + community data</td>
          <td>Maps where you fit in the conversation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>3</strong></td>
          <td>My Intellectual Map</td>
          <td>All of the above + academic sources</td>
          <td>Connects your work to scholarly traditions</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The point isn't that Version 3 is "right" and Version 1 is "wrong." The point is seeing how <strong>more context produces deeper insight</strong> &mdash; the same AI, the same platform, but fundamentally different results depending on what you give it to work with.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>When to Start This Sequence</h2>

    <p>This sequence works best when you have enough writing to analyze. You'll need at least <strong>5&ndash;8 pieces of your own writing</strong> before Version 1 becomes meaningful. If you don't have that many yet, keep writing &mdash; and come back when you do.</p>

    <div class="callout info">
      <p><strong>What you'll need:</strong> A Google account with access to Gemini. Go to <a href="https://gemini.google.com">gemini.google.com</a> and sign in. If you've already built Gems using the <a href="index.html">Building a Week of Writing</a> sequence or the <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/notebooklm-gemini-gems-for-blogs/">AI Tools Guide</a>, you know the process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout success">
      <p><strong>Ready?</strong> The next page walks you through building Version 1: My Argument Tracker. You'll upload your own writing and build a Gem that reads your collected work and tells you what argument you've been building.</p>
