    <h1 class="page-title">Finding Contradictions</h1>

    <h2>Where You Left Off</h2>

    <p>You've written two pieces, both developed with the help of your Gem. The first established your argument. The second extended it in a new direction. Now comes the most powerful step in the process.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Adding Both Pieces to the Gem</h2>

    <p>Paste both pieces into the Gem conversation. Now the Gem has everything: the original source articles, your first piece, and your second. It can see the full arc of your thinking across the week.</p>

    <div class="callout insight">
      <p><strong>Progressive context:</strong> This is the principle that powers this whole sequence. The Gem started the week knowing only two articles. Now it knows two articles <em>and</em> two pieces of your writing &mdash; your actual arguments, your voice, your emphasis, your blind spots. The same AI, the same instructions, but fundamentally more useful because of what you've given it to work with.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>The Power Move: Ask for Contradictions</h2>

    <p>This is the most valuable prompt in the whole sequence. The Gem can now see patterns across your two pieces that you probably can't see yourself.</p>

    <div class="prompt-sample">
      <p>&ldquo;Read my two pieces together. Where am I contradicting myself? Where is my argument weakest?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;What assumption am I making in both pieces that I haven't examined?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;If someone wanted to argue against my position, what would be their strongest move?&rdquo;</p>
    </div>

    <p>The Gem's answer won't always be right. But it will almost always be <em>interesting</em> &mdash; it'll identify tensions you didn't notice, or assumptions you didn't realize you were making. That's your material for Piece 3.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Finding New Sources</h2>

    <p>Use the contradictions and tensions the Gem identified to guide your source discovery. Because the Gem knows your actual argument gaps &mdash; not just your topic in general &mdash; it can suggest much more targeted search terms.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;Based on the weakness you identified, what kind of source would help me address it?&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Give me specific search terms I could use to find scholars who have written about this tension.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Is there a field or discipline I haven't considered that would have something to say about this?&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout info">
      <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Verify everything the Gem suggests. It can hallucinate authors and articles. Use its search terms, but do the searching yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Write Your Third Piece</h2>

    <p>This piece addresses the contradictions or gaps the Gem identified. This is often the strongest writing of the week because it's genuinely self-critical &mdash; you're engaging with the limits of your own argument, not just adding more support for what you already believe.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>From a Week to a Larger Body of Work</h2>

    <p>You just did something powerful: you used a Gem to build a <strong>connected body of work</strong> across a week. Three pieces, each one informed by the ones before it, each one sharper because the Gem had more context to work with.</p>

    <p>The <em>Intellectual Map</em> sequence takes this same principle further. Instead of three pieces, you feed the Gem your <strong>entire body of writing</strong>. Instead of finding contradictions within a week, it finds patterns across your whole collection. Instead of suggesting what to write next Tuesday, it shows you what argument you've been building without realizing it.</p>

    <div class="callout insight">
      <p><strong>The core principle is the same:</strong> More context produces deeper insight. A Gem with two articles and three pieces gave you a productive week. A Gem with your full body of writing gives you something closer to a map of your own thinking.</p>
