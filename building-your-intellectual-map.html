    <h1 class="page-title">Version 3: Building Your Research-Grade Intellectual Map</h1>

    <p class="lead">You've built a Gem that reads your own writing and one that maps your position in a community conversation. Now you'll build the final version: <strong>Version 3: My Intellectual Map</strong>. This one adds academic sources and a model annotated bibliography &mdash; giving the Gem enough context to connect your arguments to real scholarly traditions.</p>

    <div class="callout info">
      <p><strong>Platform option:</strong> Version 3 works in either <strong>Gemini Gems</strong> or <strong>ChatGPT Custom GPTs</strong>. Use the same instructions, documents, and prompt workflow in either platform.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Step 1: Gather Additional Knowledge Files</h2>

    <p>Keep everything from Version 2. Now add:</p>

    <h3>Academic Sources (2&ndash;3 sources)</h3>

    <p>Find 2&ndash;3 academic or professional sources related to your central themes. These could be:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Journal articles or book chapters you've encountered in courses or research</li>
      <li>Published essays or long-form journalism on your topic</li>
      <li>Wikipedia articles on the intellectual traditions your work touches (these work surprisingly well as context documents)</li>
      <li>TED talk transcripts, podcast transcripts, or other substantive public-facing scholarship</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Save each as a PDF and upload to the Gem.</p>

    <div class="callout info">
      <p><strong>Not sure what sources to use?</strong> Think about what your writing keeps circling around. If you write about AI and creativity, search for articles on "computational creativity" or "human-AI collaboration." If you write about authenticity and social media, look for work on "digital identity" or "performance of self." Your Gem will help you identify the right traditions &mdash; you just need to give it a few entry points.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>A Model Annotated Bibliography (1 page)</h3>

    <p>Save <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/engl170-spring2026-dashboard/writing-plan.html">Dr. Plate's annotated bibliography</a> as a PDF. This is the hand-built intellectual map that shows how one writer's argument connects to scholarly traditions. Giving the Gem this document lets it see how <em>one writer</em> built an intellectual map manually &mdash; and use that as a model for analyzing yours.</p>

    <div class="callout warning">
      <p><strong>Total knowledge files:</strong> You should now have roughly 15&ndash;20 files. If you hit upload limits, prioritize: your own writing first, then academic sources, then peer writing, then community data. The Gem needs <em>your</em> writing and <em>scholarly</em> context most of all for this version.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Step 2: Create a New Gem</h2>

    <p>Go back to the Gem manager and create a new Gem. Name it:</p>

    <p>If you're using ChatGPT, create a new Custom GPT from <strong>Explore GPTs</strong> &rarr; <strong>Create</strong>, then use the same name and setup.</p>

    <div class="gem-name">My Intellectual Map</div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Step 3: Write Instructions</h2>

    <p>Copy and paste the following into the instructions field:</p>

    <div class="prompt-box-dark">You are a scholarly synthesis tool for a writer. You have access to the writer's own work, other writers' pieces from their community, community-level context (profiles, topic maps), academic sources, and an annotated bibliography showing how one writer mapped their intellectual landscape. Your job is to connect the writer's informal arguments to formal scholarly traditions.

IDENTIFYING THE PRIMARY WRITER:
- The user will tell you which writer they are
- Treat their pieces as the center of analysis
- Use all other documents as context for understanding the primary writer's intellectual position

WHAT YOU DO:
- Connect arguments to scholarly traditions: when a writer argues that "error is productive," identify that as related to antifragility theory, resilience studies, or growth mindset research
- Identify intellectual lineages: trace the writer's ideas back to established thinkers, movements, or debates in their field
- Use the annotated bibliography as a model for how informal arguments connect to formal scholarship
- Suggest specific search terms, authors, or fields the writer could explore to deepen their argument with published research
- Identify which of the writer's pieces would benefit most from scholarly support — and what KIND of support (a theoretical framework, empirical evidence, a historical parallel, a counterargument)

HOW TO RESPOND:
- Always cite specific pieces and specific sources when drawing connections
- Quote from both the writer's work and the academic sources to show parallels
- Be specific about scholarly traditions — don't just say "this relates to philosophy," say "this resonates with pragmatist epistemology, particularly William James's argument that..."
- When suggesting further reading, explain WHY the source would be useful, not just what it covers
- Distinguish between direct connections (the writer is clearly engaging with this tradition) and suggestive parallels (the writer's argument echoes this tradition, perhaps without knowing it)
- Use the annotated bibliography's structure as a reference for how to explain source-to-argument connections

PORTFOLIO GUIDANCE:
- When asked, identify which pieces could become formal portfolio or publication pieces
- Explain what scholarly support each candidate piece would need
- Suggest how the writer could structure a formal argument from their informal writing

WHAT YOU DON'T DO:
- Don't evaluate the quality of the writing
- Don't fabricate scholarly connections — if there's no clear link, say so
- Don't overwhelm with references — suggest 2-3 targeted sources rather than a long reading list
- Don't assume the writer knows the scholarly terminology — explain concepts when you introduce them</div>

    <div class="callout info">
      <p><strong>Notice what's new:</strong> These instructions add three capabilities the earlier versions didn't have: connecting to scholarly traditions, suggesting further reading, and offering portfolio guidance. The Gem can now do these things because it has the <em>documents</em> to support them &mdash; the academic sources and annotated bibliography give it the scholarly context it needs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Step 4: Upload Files and Save</h2>

    <p>Upload all your knowledge files and save the Gem.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Step 5: Test</h2>

    <p>Open your Gem and identify yourself. Then try these test prompts:</p>

    <p>The same test prompts work in ChatGPT Custom GPTs.</p>

    <h3>Intellectual Traditions</h3>

    <div class="test-prompt">
      <p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> What intellectual tradition am I participating in? Based on my writing and the academic sources, what established field or debate does my work most closely connect to?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="test-prompt">
      <p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Compare how I'm engaging with [topic] to how the academic sources discuss it. Where am I aligned with the scholarship, and where am I saying something the published literature hasn't addressed?</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Further Reading</h3>

    <div class="test-prompt">
      <p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> What should I search for next? Based on my arguments and the scholarly landscape, give me 3 specific search terms or author names that would help me deepen my strongest line of thinking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="test-prompt">
      <p><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> Look at how the annotated bibliography connects informal writing to scholarly traditions. Now do the same thing for my pieces. Which of my arguments connect to established scholarship, and what sources would anchor those connections?</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Portfolio Preparation</h3>

    <div class="test-prompt">
      <p><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> Which of my pieces would make the best formal portfolio piece? Explain what scholarly support it would need and how I could structure it as a formal argument.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="test-prompt">
      <p><strong>Prompt 6:</strong> If I were writing an annotated bibliography like the model one, but centered on MY argument, what would the core sources be and how would they connect to my writing?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Three-Version Comparison</h2>

    <p>The final exercise. Ask all three Gems the exact same question:</p>

    <div class="test-prompt" style="font-size: 1.05em;">
      <p><strong>Ask all three Gems:</strong> What is the most important argument I'm making, and why does it matter?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Compare the three responses side by side:</p>

    <table class="tool-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Version</th>
          <th>What It Should Say</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Version 1</strong><br>Argument Tracker</td>
          <td>Describes your argument in terms of <em>your</em> patterns and themes. "You keep returning to the question of..." Personal and introspective.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Version 2</strong><br>Network Mapper</td>
          <td>Describes your argument in terms of <em>the conversation</em>. "Your position relative to [other writer] is..." "You're contributing something that no one else in the network is..." Relational and contextual.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Version 3</strong><br>Intellectual Map</td>
          <td>Describes your argument in terms of <em>intellectual traditions</em>. "Your line of thinking connects to..." "This echoes what [scholar] argues about..." "The scholarly term for what you're doing is..." Synthesized and anchored.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout insight">
      <p style="font-size: 1.05em;"><strong>This is the whole point.</strong> Same AI. Same platform. Same question. Three fundamentally different answers &mdash; because each version had different context to work with. The technology didn't get smarter. <em>You</em> made it smarter by giving it better materials.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>What You've Learned</h2>

    <p>By building three versions of the same tool, you've practiced the core applied AI skill: <strong>better instructions + better documents = a more powerful tool</strong>. Specifically:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Context shapes insight</strong> &mdash; The same AI produces trivial observations with one document and genuine intellectual synthesis with twenty. The difference is never the technology. It's always the input.</li>
      <li><strong>Instruction design matters</strong> &mdash; Vague instructions ("analyze my writing") produce vague results. Structured instructions with clear categories, specific behaviors, and explicit boundaries produce focused, useful analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytical AI is different from generative AI</strong> &mdash; Using AI to read, map, and synthesize your existing work is a fundamentally different skill than using AI to generate new text. Both are valuable. The analytical use may be more valuable.</li>
      <li><strong>You built something real</strong> &mdash; Your intellectual map isn't a class exercise. It's a tool you can keep using and updating as you write more, find more sources, and develop your argument further.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout success">
      <p><strong>Keep building.</strong> Your intellectual map gets more powerful every time you add new writing, new peer work, or new sources. As your argument develops, update your Version 3 Gem with new material. Over time, you'll have a tool that maps your entire intellectual journey.</p>
